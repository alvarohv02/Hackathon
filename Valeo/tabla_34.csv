Risk factor,Potential impact on the Group and risk management
"As the Group conducts its business in an international environment, Group entities conducting cross-border operations may be exposed to operational currency risk, resulting from purchases or sales of products or services in currencies other than their functional currency. The financing needs, met by intra-Group borrowings, of foreign subsidiaries outside the eurozone expose some entities of the Group to financial currency risk. This risk corresponds to the risk of changes in the value of financial receivables or payables denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the borrowing or lending entity.","The Group's earnings may be adversely impacted in the event of significant fluctuations in certain currencies. See Chapter 5, section 5.4.6, Note 8.1.4.1 ""Fair value of foreign currency derivatives"" to the consolidated financial statements, pages 365 to 367."
