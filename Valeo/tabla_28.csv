Risk factor,Potential impact on the Group and risk management
The Group operates in a competitive environment and in a sector that is undergoing radical change. This requires,"Failure by the Group to attract and retain talent could impact its product innovation, development, launch and production, and have a negative impact on its business, financial results and reputation."
"an increase in human resources as well
as a broader spectrum of critical skills to ensure that it can adapt to changes in the automotive industry. However, Valeo may face difficulties; firstly, in attracting and retaining talent, and secondly, in adapting and taking on the necessary qualifications and skill sets to develop and manufacture its systems and products. The Group's huge investments in innovation mean that it needs to carry out targeted recruitment of skilled Managers and Professionals. The scarcity of labor in certain employment areas makes it difficult to hire the employees needed to increase production.","For more information on the program, policies and actions implemented by the Human Resources Department and the related results, see Chapter 4, section 4.3.3 ""Valeo's non-financial risks"", paragraphs ""Risk related to attracting talent"" and ""Risk related to developing and retaining talent"", pages 259 to 266."
,"Attracting the highest performers is a key challenge for the Group amid a competitive environment undergoing a profound transformation. To meet its growth and development objectives, a recruitment organization system is in place in the form of Talent Acquisition Centers (TACs). These TACs bring together all teams dedicated to scouting and attracting talent in a given country or region. In 2023, Valeo focused on the speed and efficiency of its recruitment procedures. As a result of these measures, 87% of job vacancies were filled. A co-optation program is in place for employees. The Group regularly reports on career opportunities and job vacancies through a variety of channels, particularly its website, as well as social networks and partnerships with higher education institutions including universities, engineering schools and business schools. In June 2023, Valeo organized its first ""Valeo recruits women"" day in partnership with Elles bougent, an association that works to help women engineers secure jobs in industrial, scientific and technological environments. Ensuring that high-performing employees remain with the Group is also a key priority for Valeo. Wishing to facilitate quick and successful integration, the Group has continued to develop a dedicated new portal as well as an onboarding program called ""Valeo Discovery"" for its Managers and Professionals. Valeo's internal mobility policy is based on annual interviews as well as on ""country mobility forums"", which were launched in 2019. The aim is to better identify all employees looking for mobility opportunities and be able to place them in vacant positions across the country concerned. Since 2020, an annual Career Week has been organized and an Internal Mobility Charter has been created to enable employees to accelerate their career paths. An e-learning platform was also rolled out within the Group to develop employees' skills. To promote managers' development, the Group has rolled out a worldwide mentoring program called ""Grow Together"". In 2023, 577 employees from 22 countries took part in the program, with 291 mentees and 286 mentors, 38% of whom were women. An ambitious compensation, career development and training policy is also a critical way of recognizing, developing and leveraging talent. Manager training is a priority for the Group: three new training programs were launched in 2022 and more than 3,200 managers have already completed them. Valeo seeks to encourage diversity when recruiting talent: in 2023, 28% of Managers and Professionals hired were women. The Group seeks to promote women to senior management positions with the aim of doubling the number of women within the Group's various management committees to 32% by 2030. Progress on this objective is monitored and reviewed several times a year. In 2023, women made up 23.6% of the Group's various management committees, in line with the Group's objectives. In order to remain attentive to its employees and improve their satisfaction, the Group conducted a digital survey of over 94,000 employees in 2023, which had a participation rate of 81%. The survey covered a number of topics, enabling the Group to gain a clearer understanding of what drives employee engagement. Valeo has rolled out action plans in each country addressing local recruitment and employee loyalty issues, particularly in areas of full employment. The Group strives to recruit its blue-collar workers from the communities surrounding its plants. Wherever possible, it hires under permanent rather than temporary contracts while maintaining a certain degree of flexibility. It also adapts its teams' work schedules and ensures that new recruits are well integrated. The Group's compensation, training and career development policy is key to retaining blue-collar staff."
