"Standards, amendments and interpretations","Amendments to IAS 12 - International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules Effective as of January 1, 2023"
Presentation and general principles,"Under the Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules defined at international level by the OECD Inclusive Framework (the ""GloBE rules""), multinational enterprises with turnover (sales) of more than 750 million euros are subject to a 15% global minimum tax rate. These rules are set out in the European Union directive adopted on December 14, 2022, which was transposed into French law in the Finance Act for 2024, applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024. On May 23, 2023, the IASB published final amendments to IAS 12 - ""Income Taxes"". The amendments provide for temporary mandatory relief from recognizing deferred taxes for the impact of the top-up tax arising from the Pillar Two rules and require new disclosures to be provided in the notes to the financial statements. The amendments do not specify for how long the relief will be available to companies."
Impacts and applications for the Group,"The Valeo Group does not use aggressive tax schemes and does not operate in any tax havens. Consequently, based on the country-by-country report, few of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates have an effective tax rate below 15%. Furthermore, the Group's manufacturing entities use significant material and human resources, generating considerable substance-based income. Under these conditions, the estimates made to date show no significant impact from the implementation of the GloBE rules."
