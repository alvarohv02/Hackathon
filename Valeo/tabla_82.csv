Training dedicated to fire prevention,
"Following the fire that ravaged the plant in Ben Arous (Tunisia) in 2021, the Health, Safety and Environment team made a fire awareness and training course available to all employees. This Fire Prevention-Evacuation training combines theory and practice, giving people the keys to reacting properly when a fire breaks out. It also covers evacuation instructions, the use of fire extinguishers, and the consequences of moving around in a smoke-filled environment. Augmented reality glasses are also available and used to simulate different types of fire outbreaks.",
