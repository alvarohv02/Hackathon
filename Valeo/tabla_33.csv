"The Group's supply chain and delivery procedures apply worldwide and incorporate all physical and information flows throughout the logistics process, upstream and downstream of plants and warehouses. A breakdown in this chain arising from either internal or external factors - whether regarding supply, transportation or logistics - exposes the Group to the risk that it will be unable to deliver on schedule the quantities required, or that the products supplied fail to meet the requisite quality standards.",Supply chain failure risk
,"Failures in the supply chain could lead to production line interruptions and production stoppages at automakers. This would also generate additional costs (exceptional transportation, financial and commercial penalties due to customer production stoppages). The Group's earnings and financial position could be affected."
,A failure in the supply chain could result:
,"· either from internal events such as a failure to place orders or a miscalculation of requirements, poor anticipation of transportation capacities, delays in the configuration of flows, or internal transportation and logistics accidents;"
,"· or from external events such as natural disasters, pandemics, political crises, conflicts, war, strikes, cyber attacks, accidents or attacks on means of transportation, as well as the lack of transport supply or the global shortage of a commodity (e.g., electronic components)."
,The Group manages this risk using various processes:
,"· the application of safety guidelines regarding traffic, handling equipment and storage in racks in order to limit the risk of internal accidents;"
,"· an ""inbound material flow strategy"", which is designed to take control of long- distance transportation flows, while locating returnable supplier inventories as close as possible to where they are needed, provided this is permitted by applicable laws and regulations;"
,"· supply chain checklists. These allow Valeo to verify that logistics processes have been implemented throughout projects, by systematically applying the Group's logistics standards and failure mode analyses to the supply chain; · the securing of supplier capacities through the ""early open order"" process; · the entire strategic, operational and execution planning process, which now covers 24 months in advance;"
,"· a formal document listing Valeo's supply chain and logistics requirements. This document is sent to all suppliers of primary materials and parts; · the logistics protocols signed by Valeo with its production suppliers; · the transportation protocols signed by Valeo with its haulers; · the information systems that update inventory movements, cyclical inventory standards and the specific control reports from these systems (inventory coverage, transit operation tracking, etc.); · supervision of transportation flows by means of hauler alerts;"
,"· the ""Logistic Red Alert"" process, which now incorporates alerts related to tier 2 suppliers;"
,"· a unit of specialists (Supply Chain Management Allocation and Risk Team) focused on high-risk technologies within the Electronics segment, which decides how requirements and resources are allocated across all Group sites;"
,"· tools and processes to provide complete visibility of needs and resources across the supply chain, from suppliers to customers."
,"Since 2022, international conflicts and climate change have led to a reorganization of transportation flows, resulting in an increase in in-transit inventories and risks of disruption."
