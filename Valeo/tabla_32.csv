Risk factor,Potential impact on the Group and risk management
"In purchasing primarily specific products, Valeo is exposed to the risk that one of its suppliers fails to deliver on schedule the quantities required, or that the products supplied fail to meet the requisite quality standards.",Supplier failure risk
,"Failure of one or more of the Group's major suppliers in this respect could cause interruptions to suppliers and prevent the Group from delivering to its customers, or cause returns of products under warranty or product recalls."
,"This would also generate additional costs (exceptional transportation costs, deterioration in the supplier's production facilities or financial difficulties of the supplier). The Group's earnings and financial position could be affected."
,Supplier failure could result:
,"· from Valeo growing on innovative markets, thereby leading it to increase its share of business among an optimal number of suppliers;"
,"· from a structural change in automotive markets and the disappearance of certain products, which could immediately impact a supplier's financial staying power if that supplier were unable to reposition itself on other markets; or"
,"· from an economic crisis, such as the 2020 health crisis, if it were to last longer than the supplier's cash resources. Although the supplier default rate is contained, the inflationary context and rising interest rate environment are weighing on the financial strength of the supplier base."
,The Group ensures secure relations with its suppliers through:
,"· a solid risk identification and monitoring process for each new contract and new business awarded, as well as for new suppliers with a long history with recently consolidated entities;"
,"· continuous monitoring of the supplier base in accordance with supplier risk assessment procedures based on criteria including financial and management criteria, dependence on Valeo, integration and quality, as set out in IATF standard 16949(1);"
,"· a watchlist of high-risk suppliers, who are monitored monthly by the Group Purchasing Committee. Emergency stockpiles are built up where necessary and/or additional production facilities launched;"
,"· a product civil liability insurance program for its suppliers. Each supplier can subscribe and thereby meet the Group's coverage standards in terms of product defect risks. As a result, they are covered against any harm they may cause Valeo as a result of the products they supply;"
,"· diversified supply streams in order to mitigate supplier failure risk as much as possible while maintaining acceptable economic conditions. The markets for certain materials and product families may, in certain cases, be exposed to supply limitations for cyclical reasons, depending on the supply regions. In order to cover this risk, several suppliers may be sought for each business and each region and included in the panel. Ninety-five percent of Valeo's needs are handled by 1,986 suppliers. The Group's biggest supplier accounts for 3.9% of its purchases, its five biggest suppliers, 10.3% and its ten biggest suppliers, 14.3%. In addition, a detailed action plan involving the Purchasing Department, the Research and Development Department and the Industrial Department, set up following the recent supply shortages observed for certain electronic components, was maintained in 2022. Under this plan, the Group's projected requirements are to be communicated to its supplier database and the purchasing strategy is to systematically factor in purchases of components in product designs. Valeo is highly involved with its suppliers, in particular to continually improve the quality of the products it delivers to automakers. This does not mean, however, that there are ownership links between Valeo and its suppliers."
