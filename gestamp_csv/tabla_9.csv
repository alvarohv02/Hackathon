ANNUAL REPORT 2023,GESTAMP'S EV CONCEPT,
INDEX,"Electrification is an unstoppable trend for the automotive sector, with diverse factors driving it forward, the most important of which is the growth in urban populations and the improvement in the air quality there.","It should be noted that the company has collaborated in different types of mobility beyond electrification itself. Thus, projects have been developed for cars that cover long distances, small cars for cities, and concepts referred to as ""urban people mover"" and ""last mile delivery""."
1. Letter from the Chairman,"Gestamp's strategy remains to constantly accompany its customers in order to offer them the best innovations for their vehicles and, in the case of electric vehicles (EV), to help them in the transition to electric vehicles.",

3. ESG Perspective 4. Environmental Dimension 5. Social Dimension 6. Governance,"The Electric Vehicle area and Gestamp's R&D teams are offering various solutions, such as the new electric battery box, chassis components integrating the new electric motors. These components meet traditional specifications like durability. rigidity, and strength, but they need to be optimised in terms of noise transmission and energy absorption during collisions due to the specific architecture of battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Additionally, innovations in the use of different materials are being pursued to reduce weight and provide more suitable solutions for new electric platforms. The motto is: the right materials in the right place.",
7. Annexes,"The impact behaviour is different in a battery electric vehicle (BEV), mainly due to the higher weight and low centre of gravity of the battery system. In addition, the higher mass of the batteries also contributes to the potential energy of the vehicle in case of a collision. Gestamp has developed a wide range of body in white products to increase safety and protect battery passengers in the event of a collision.",
