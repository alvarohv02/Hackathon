Transition risks,,,,,
Market,Variation in resource availability,:selected: Short Term,High,"Variation in the availability of resources can have consequences on the cost of raw materials, which could lead to shortages, increases in input costs due to a reduction in supply or a decrease in product quality.","Thanks to the lightening of parts, Gestamp has managed to reduce the use of raw materials in its parts and has opted for a circularity strategy where the reintroduction of scrap as a secondary raw material becomes fundamental in the system. In this sense, it has established agreements with suppliers to enable the availability of materials with a high recycled content, and in turn, more sustainable."
Technological,Transition to low-emission technologies,:selected: Long Term,High,"The transition to low-emission technologies will entail a number of associated costs, notably in the purchase of new equipment or the replacement of models and/or manufacturing technologies with cleaner alternatives.",The R&D departments at Gestamp co-develop new technological and product solutions with customers which reduce emissions during the manufacture and life of vehicles.
