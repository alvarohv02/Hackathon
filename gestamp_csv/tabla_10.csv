:unselected:",Gestamp's R&D teams are constantly developing new,Three partial cooling methods have been employed to obtain,
,"technologies in line with customer needs in order to increase performance or reduce weight. One example is the launch of new advanced cold-formed steels with improved strength properties, which enable weight reduction by applying the knowledge and experience gained in the forming and development of chassis products. Development teams focus on innovative design approaches to deliver optimised high- performance products; from increasing service life by design and minimising weight through in-house optimisation tools coupled with manufacturing expertise to achieve 10-15% mass reduction, to the introduction of new paint processes to improve corrosion protection.","different mechanical properties across a part and achieve better shock performance. And new degrees of hardness/absorption have been achieved that allow for even better deformation control. Gestamp has managed to produce parts with ""soft zones"" that have different degrees of hardness and absorb the force of impact, with different production processes: · During forming: in the die/forming tool. · After forming: post-treatment by alternative heat source, laser, induction, Ges-Softbend.",· Multistep · 2000 Mpa & Soft Zone Bkt · Hotstamping Aluminium · Furnace Soft Zone · Alu Multimaterial · Alu Extrusion

,,"The low level of formability and the high elastic recovery of this material in the conventional cold stamping process has motivated the R&D department to process hot stamping, where design pieces very similar to those made of steel are achieved, but much lighter and with almost zero elastic recovery.","For the manufacture of battery boxes, new aluminum extrusion"
,,,
,This material is manufactured using a laser post-treatment that gives it sufficient ductility to obtain the best results in impact tests.,,processes have been developed in which large section profiles with high ductility are produced. This makes it possible to manufacture boxes with very light frames to protect the battery.
