"3.4. Manufacture of batteries, cells and accumulators",,"In 2022, electric vehicles enabled a net reduction of around 80 Mt of GHG emissions. As the electric vehicle fleet continues to grow, emissions reductions will become even more significant, playing a key role in achieving the goals set out in the Paris Agreement. Therefore, fundamental parts for the correct functioning of this type of vehicle, such as batteries and, therefore, battery boxes, are essential."
,Eligible according to the definition of the activity contemplated in the Climate Royal Decree.,"Following this rationale and based on the comparison of the analysis of CO2eq/Km and total CO2eq emissions throughout the life cycle of a conventional vehicle versus an electric vehicle, we consider that battery boxes are essential for the substantial reduction of emissions. in transportation as the main component of electric vehicles."
3.18. Manufacturing of automotive and mobility components,,"The technical description of this activity includes the manufacture, repair, maintenance, renewal, reconversion and modernization of components that are essential to ensure and improve the environmental performance of vehicles with zero direct CO2 emissions described in the Royal Decree. In this sense, Gestamp includes the manufacture of Door Rings through hot stamping, a production process that reduces the final weight of the vehicle."
,Eligible according to the definition of the activity contemplated in the Climate Royal Decree.,"The Door Ring is an essential part of the vehicle since it constitutes a fundamental part of the bodywork. Reducing the weight of this part through hot stamping makes the final vehicle lighter compared to parts that do not follow this production system. This is because thanks to this technology, the number of parts used is reduced and its thickness is reduced, allowing safer and lighter metal components to be manufactured, which means lightening the total weight of the vehicle, reducing energy consumption and, therefore, reducing CO2 emissions (improving the environmental performance of the vehicle). As shown in the analysis carried out on the life cycle of the Door Ring, the emissions associated with the raw material purchasing, manufacturing and vehicle use stages are reduced thanks to this technology."
,,"Therefore, we consider that the lightening of parts is essential for the vehicle to improve its environmental performance as we show throughout the 2023 Annual Report."
