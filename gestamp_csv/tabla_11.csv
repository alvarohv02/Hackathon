ANNUAL REPORT 2023,,,,,PARTICIPATION IN STRATEGIC EVENTS
INDEX,Gesta,,T 海斯坦,1BF011,"Gestamp has participated in different strategic events throughout 2023. From international fairs to technological events, also having different events directly at the headquarters of different clients. This year 2023 has left behind digital events, which were protagonists during previous years due to COVID-19 and which had already lost strength in 2022. Although these types of digital events such as Webinars have resolved different scenarios thanks to their versatility, the year 2023 reflects that the best option to promote innovations, technologies and products are physical events."
