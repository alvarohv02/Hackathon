Risk #2,Inequality of economic development in host territories
Mitigation Strategy,Implementing measures in two separate areas:
,· Identification of local suppliers and assisting them to gain the needed skills and operational capacity
,"· Encourage our existing suppliers to relocate to clusters near to its facilities By implementing these measures we are able to gain operational proximity which supports progress in technology, CSR and logistics. We also improve supply chain flexibility and reduce supply chain risk. By enhancing control of Tier-n suppliers it is possible to take account of the supply risks inherent in the multi-layered subcontracting chain."
Additional Opportunities,"· Reduce inbound logistics elements such as costs, CO2 emissions and time to deliver products and services to our operations · Better knowledge of local operating methods and in the local stakeholder expectations"
,· Focusing on local supplier development can support suppliers becoming more competitive and could drive the ability to access more international organizations in the future · Strengthen brand recognition and potentially increase sales of our products

Risk #3,Environmental impacts from operations and natural disasters within the supply chain
Risk Description,"It is necessary to develop supply chains that are sustainable and can successfully manage multiple environmental impacts; such as those related to their own operations, physical damage from natural disasters or supply shortages. For activities related to supplier operations, starting from raw materials through to the production of goods and services, environmental impacts need to be appropriately addressed with robust standard operating procedures. The risk for supply disruption and reputational damage can occur if sufficient attention to an issue is lacking. Evaluating the impact of procuring and transporting the products, goods and materials through the supply chain (from the purchase of raw materials to network distribution) is essential to manage consumer expectations and the risks posed from the increasing number, scope and ambition of regulatory requirements. Potential Impact · Ecosystem degradation < 6.1.3 >, i.e., deforestation and mining · Climate change < 2.3.1.2 > · Natural disasters (earthquake, tornado, tsunami, flooding, etc) "" Exposure to eco-taxes levied on transport, as well as fossil energy price fluctuations · Localized pollution impacts such as water, air and sound e.g., bauxite mining for aluminum production"
