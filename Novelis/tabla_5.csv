,"Using aluminum to lighten the vehicle body and/or closures creates possibilities for secondary lightweighting, too. A lighter body means a vehicle can achieve the same acceleration, driving performance, and range with smaller brakes, suspension parts, motor, and battery. These secondary weight savings are linked to even more CO2e emissions savings.","Steel ICE Vehicle Manufacturing Phase
