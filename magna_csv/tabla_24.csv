consistent outcomes and experiences for our employees. 4.3.3 Strengthening Strategic Partnerships,"We are continuing to progress our agenda to increase the number of women in Magna. On a global basis, approximately 28% of the employees in our wholly owned operations are women. A total of approximately 4,958 employees in our wholly owned operations occupy critical roles with 885 of such employees, or 18%, being women. Both the percentage of women in our wholly owned operations, and the percentage of women in critical roles increased slightly from the previous year. Underrepresentation of women in our workforce is most pronounced in IT, operations, and product engineering career streams, which is a consistent trend throughout the automotive industry.

As part of our succession planning program we continue to identify high-potential, diverse talent candidates and implement accelerated development plans to support their progression to advanced roles. During talent and succession discussions, there is an increased level of focus on the number of women and diverse candidates nominated into each of our succession pools."

Recognizing the importance of improving gender diversity within key technical career streams and to support the development of the next generation of the talent in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), we have formed strategic partnerships with a number of organizations that promote gender diversity in technical career streams.

We also participate in various automotive advisory groups to ensure the focus on Diversity and Inclusion in the industry remains strong. We are leveraging the experience of organizations focused on inclusion to ensure Magna continues to be positioned as an employer of choice and to enhance our partnership criteria to embed diversity and inclusion into evaluations, selections, and agreements.","In addition, the Board as a whole continues to advocate for improved gender representation and other diversity in leadership and other critical roles, as well as STEM career streams. In addition to their strong advocacy, the female directors of the Board, currently representing 38% of our Board of Directors, have also sought opportunities to mentor and share their experiences with the company's high-performing female employees.
