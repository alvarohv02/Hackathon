In the near- and medium-terms, adoption of renewable energy may increase our energy costs, but we are working to offset the impact of such increases through energy use reductions. While we currently have a few examples of renewable energy self-generation at certain facilities, self-generation is not a significant opportunity for us primarily since the vast majority of our facilities are leased, as well as other factors such as footprint constraints for solar panels at certain owned facilities, and/or facilities in locations with relatively clean electrical grids that make self-generation",,,,

The integration of energy management elements into a core operational assessment tool such as MAFACT is intended to reinforce the importance of energy management throughout the organization and help realize potential cost savings. In 2023, we implemented over 1,400 energy projects across all of our Operating Groups which resulted in approximately 76,000 tons of CO2 equivalent in annual savings using the location-based method and approximately 62,000 tons of CO2 equivalent in annual savings",,,,"We have implemented a 1.5% per year water reduction target, with the aim of reducing water use 15% by 2030, in each case referencing 2019 as the baseline year. To date, we have met this target, having achieved a reduction of 15% at the end of 2023. While we are not a significant water user, achievement of water reductions would be expected to result in cost savings, potentially by offsetting (in whole or in part) any increase in the rates charged by applicable water utilities. Overall, we do not anticipate that any savings will be material.",,,,
