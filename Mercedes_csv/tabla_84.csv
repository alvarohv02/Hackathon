"The lower weight leads to a decreased need for primary energy along the vehicle's path from production to use and finally to the end-of-life phase. Moreover, the material, which is made of natural fibres, is very break-resistant and thus contributes to vehicle safety.","In addition, the Mercedes-Benz Group works together with suppliers to continually improve the environmental compatibility of leather products. For example, the partners must submit a lifecycle assessment for the entire value chain. In this way, targeted measures can be taken to reduce the ecological footprint of the leather. The Mercedes-Benz Group emphatically opposes any form of illegal deforestation. It requires its suppliers not to contribute to or benefit from illegal deforestation in the course of their own business activities. Moreover, it contractually obligates its suppliers to take due dili- gence measures to support the protection of natural forests in the upstream supply chain. Mercedes-Benz AG sources only a small proportion of the leather in its value chain from Brazil. In order to develop solutions for deforestation-free leather supply chains, it signed a memorandum of understanding with a supplier and an international organisation in 2023. The focus is on hides that are procured for further pro- cessing and ultimately for equipping selected model series. Mercedes-Benz AG is working with its partners on the use and auditing of tracking systems for the traceability of finished leather back to its origin.","people and the environment. Mercedes-Benz AG is thus also following the recommendation of O non-govern- :selected: mental organisations (NGOs), politicians and other rele- vant interest groups, who advise against general with- drawal from high-risk countries."
Leather and leather alternatives: more sustainable handling,,"At the same time, the Mercedes-Benz Group is researching animal-free, resource-conserving alterna- tives to genuine leather. In the development and selec- tion of these materials, it pays attention to the highest possible recycled content or the use of renewable raw materials instead of crude oil-based raw materials.

"The Mercedes-Benz Group attaches great importance to a more environmentally compatible processing of materials, such as leather. From 2023 onwards, it has been gradually using even more sustainably produced and processed leather in its model series. The criteria range from animal husbandry to the tanning process.",,
"For example, the Mercedes-Benz Group stipulates com- pliance with various animal welfare criteria. The Group requires its suppliers to comply with the ""5 Freedoms of Animal Welfare"" for animal husbandry issued by the Animal Welfare Committee, for example. In future, only vegetable, organic mineral or alternative tanning agents that are completely chrome-free - such as dried coffee bean shells, chestnuts or extracts from other renewable raw materials - may be used in a tanning process that is less harmful to the environment. For electric vehicles in the future, leather may only be processed in tanneries that are certified according to the Gold Standard of the",,"Batteries are a key component of electric mobility. At the Mercedes-Benz Group, experts from various disci- plines are working on all aspects of battery technol- ogy - from basic research to production maturity. The Mercedes-Benz Group is pursuing two goals in this respect: on the one hand, it wants to keep reducing the use of critical materials such as cobalt in its batteries. On the other, it intends to procure battery cells exclu- sively with raw materials from mines that are audited in accordance with the ""Standard for Responsible Mining"" of the O Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA)."
"""Leather Working Group"". This includes important envi- ronmental aspects such as reducing the use of water, energy and chemicals in the tanning process.","The company has decided to continue sourcing a small percentage of its leather from Brazil, as it does not fun- damentally rule out high-risk areas as sources of critical raw materials. It applies the principle of ""empowerment before withdrawal"": instead of withdrawing, the aim is to make a contribution to better local protection of",105
