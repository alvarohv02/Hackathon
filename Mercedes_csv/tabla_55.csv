Their goal is to avoid shipments as much as possi- ble and to optimise routes and transport systems. In addition, the teams apply additional measures for net carbon-neutrality, e.g. in production or with customised charging concepts.","Further development through dialogue In order to review its management approach and adapt it if necessary, the Mercedes-Benz Group engages in dialogue on the topic of climate protection and uses the findings obtained: in its annual @ ""Sustainability Dia- logue"" it conducts an intensive dialogue with environ- mental institutes and O non-governmental organisa- :selected:

In,"To enable comprehensive recording and control of the CO2 contribution of the individual units, data transpar- ency over the entire lifecycle is the key factor: for this purpose, the Mercedes-Benz Group has developed an internal monitoring tool for CO2 calculation. This makes it possible to track progress towards CO2 targets down to component level - and for the first time to precisely identify climate-relevant emissions. At the same time, the fleet level can also be analysed. The CO2 monitoring tool provides two central perspectives on climate pro-","tions (NGOs). In addition, the topic of climate protection is an integral part of regular Board of Man- agement meetings; current developments are dis- cussed with the Advisory Board for Integrity and Sus- tainability. Politicians, the general public and other stakeholders of the Mercedes-Benz Group also provide the company with regular feedback on how the compa- ny's own sustainability goals are perceived and assessed."
