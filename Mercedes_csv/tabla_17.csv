"With regard to economic activity 3.3, the EU Taxonomy Regulation requires an assessment and, if possible, the application of measures that promote the transition to a circular economy, including the use of secondary mate- rials, high durability of products and waste manage- ment in production. When developing products, the Mercedes-Benz Group considers the concept of circular economy from the very start and has set itself the over- arching goal of increasing its use of secondary materials in vehicles. In addition, the DNSH criteria for economic activity 6.5 are taken into account through the imple- mentation of the legal requirements on recyclability and reusability for passenger car models and light commer- cial vehicles. The Mercedes-Benz Group is intensifying its efforts to use lower volumes of raw materials and other materials in its production operations. In accordance with the","With regard to the DNSH criteria, for economic activity 3.3 under Appendix C (Annex I) of the delegated act of the EU (Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139), the Tax- onomy Regulation refers to the concept of avoiding the manufacturing, placing on the market or use of restricted and reportable substances subject to current European legislation on chemicals. The implementation of internal processes for specification, approval and control is intended to ensure compliance with European regulations (according to Appendix C) and respective national legislations. The Global Automotive Declarable Substance List (GADSL) forms the basis for the prohibi- tion and declaration requirement of substances in Mercedes-Benz products. The Mercedes-Benz Group also defines specifications for substitution analyses, and thus for the use of less critical hazardous sub- stances. With regard to economic activity 6.5, the DNSH criteria refer to compliance with various product-related Euro- pean regulations and directives. As a result, all-electric vehicles are currently considered in the Taxono- my-aligned scopes of economic activity 6.5.","uct Database for Energy Labelling (EPREL) shall be used. The time of market placement of the vehicles in the leasing and financing portfolio was used for the analysis, and a percentage share of the vehicles with the respective highest tyre classes according to EPREL was determined on the basis of a representative time period. This proportion is applied to the leasing and financing portfolio of all-electric vehicles worldwide wherever the corresponding data is available.

Fur- thermore, environmental impact assessments or com- parable audits outside the EU are carried out in the context of a new site or the extension of an existing site, if legally required. In addition, the Group has established environmental management systems in accordance with ISO 14001 at its production sites."
