:selected:","Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans use around 4.8 million tonnes of raw materials per year to manufacture their products. 3.47 million tonnes of this are metals and 1.36 million tonnes non-metals. Both segments are particularly focusing on limiting the amount of primary material, and increasingly compen- sating for this by using secondary materials. To this end, they already follow the ""Design for Environment""","project back in 2015. The result is a holistic approach that is still used by engineers in both segments in the early stages of vehicle development. The procedure of the ""ESSENZ"" method is based on the lifecycle assess- ment methodology, which allows a systematic analysis of the environmental impacts along the entire lifecycle of a vehicle. 102"
