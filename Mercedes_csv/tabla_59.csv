The Mercedes-Benz Charging Network is open to driv- ers of all brands. It currently allows charging capacities,"supply of green electricity or alternatively through green electricity certificates from accredited providers. The high charging power of up to 350 KW per charging point enables correspondingly designed vehicles to charge their batteries quickly. The approximately 3,000 charging points of IONITY are integrated into Mercedes me Charge and can be conveniently used via Plug & Charge. Simply plugging in the charging cable is enough to authenticate, start the charging process and pay - it is not absolutely necessary to use an app or charging card. The number of IONITY fast-charging parks is set to rise to more than 1,000 across Europe by 2025. The inten- tion is to build these near urban centres in future, and to equip some of them with canopies to ensure conven- ient charging even in changeable weather.",be guaranteed through supply contracts and green electricity certificates.
