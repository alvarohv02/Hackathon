To this end, the Group is focusing on expanding strategic part- nerships with battery cell producers that supply the Mercedes-Benz Group's global battery production net- work with battery cells and modules manufactured in a net carbon-neutral manner. The Group also seeks to diversify its raw material procurement and strengthen the resilience of its supply chains, thereby reducing dependencies.","In order to achieve the ambitious goals of the electric ramp-up, the company is also working with its partners to develop new sources of raw materials with the aim of diversifying raw material procurement.

,"Mercedes-Benz AG is increasingly pursuing a local-for- local approach: component products and materials for Mercedes-Benz vehicles are preferably to be purchased in the vicinity of the respective production facility. This not only reduces costs and supply chain risks, but also contributes to sustainability by shortening transport routes, for example. Mercedes-Benz AG has therefore entered into several strategic battery partnerships worldwide, with various suppliers in different regions. On the road to a fully electric future, Mercedes-Benz AG has acquired a stake in ACC, the Automotive Cells Com- pany (ACC), in order to establish a European battery cell module supplier with global ambitions. Together with","Mercedes-Benz AG aims to achieve a further reduction in CO2 emissions in battery production by using renew- able energies in the production and refinement of raw materials. One example of this is the partnership with the German-Canadian start-up Rock Tech Inc., which is building a refinery for lithium hydroxide in Guben (Ger- many). The supply agreement stipulates that both part- ners will work together on a roadmap for the net car- bon-neutral production of lithium hydroxide by 2030. Mercedes-Benz AG is thus taking an important step towards local-for-local, and at the same time deepening the vertical integration of drive technologies in order to achieve its electrification targets in Europe. 79"
