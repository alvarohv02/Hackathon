"Sled tests are crash tests in which a vehicle does not collide with a wall or other object. Instead, the vehicle body shell with the components to be tested are mounted on a sled that is then suddenly braked. As a","The STOP principle describes the order of priority that an employer must observe when defining and imple- menting protective measures. This applies to health hazards as well as fire and explosion hazards. STOP stands for substitution as well as technical, organisa- tional and personal measures.
