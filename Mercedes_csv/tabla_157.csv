More efficient parking space utilisation thanks to,Mobility concept for Stuttgart Hospital,"More sustainable delivery traffic in cities The SUSTAINEER from Mercedes-Benz Vans shows what more sustainable delivery traffic in cities could look like in the future. This O technology demonstrater :selected: based on the Mercedes-Benz eSprinter combines a variety of innovative solutions to improve the quality of life in cities, protect the climate and the environment, and increase the safety and @ well-being of drivers and other road users. In practice, this primarily involves the quiet and efficient delivery of goods and parcels. Among other things, the Mercedes-Benz SUSTAINEER features a low-noise electric drive, low rolling resist- ance tyres and digital outside mirrors. The SUSTAINEER"
digital register,"In 2022, the Urban Mobility Solutions team had already carried out a mobility analysis for Stuttgart Hospital. In the reporting year, it intensified its collaboration to develop a concept for electric mobility that focussed on charging infrastructure: Urban Mobility Solutions has drawn up a prediction for the necessary installation of charging points in the hospital's underground car parks by 2040, and also advised on installation and use. The team concluded that the hospital can make a major contribution to the successful electrification of inner- city traffic thanks to its many parking spaces in the cen- tre of Stuttgart. Mobility issues in stakeholder dialogue Under the motto ""Future roads. Future cars. Future partnerships. Coming together to create balance"", UMS organised the international ""Mercedes-Benz Inspiration Day"" at the Sindelfingen (Germany) location in June 2023. Around 80 representatives from cities and regions, public authorities, start-ups and research insti- tutes as well as the Mercedes-Benz Group met there to discuss the promotion of public-private cooperation. The participants also debated mobility issues in urban areas and beyond. The talks also laid the foundations for future collaborations.",
"Together with the city of Freiburg, the Mercedes-Benz Group used anonymised parking data from its vehicles and O artificial intelligence (AI) to map all parking :selected: spaces along the city's streets, which were then trans- ferred to a digital parking place directory. The AI-gener- ated register was compared with data that was manu- ally recorded and data collected during inspections of selected locations to ensure a high level of data accu- racy. The aim was to provide the city with an up-to-date overview of the available urban parking space and to enable it to find reliable answers to neighbour- hood-specific questions. This would have been a far more involved process with purely manual surveys. The Mercedes-Benz Group is planning to expand the project to other cities in 2024 as part of a series test.",,
,,"is also equipped with intelligent software and commu- nication solutions that allow efficient route planning in real time. This not only reduces the number of kilo- metres driven, but also energy consumption. The SUS- TAINEER is constantly being enhanced to include new ideas and sustainability-related solutions, while it is also used by the Mercedes-Benz Vans division to test these. 71 Climate protection in vehicles and services - Electrified product range at Mercedes-Benz Vans
