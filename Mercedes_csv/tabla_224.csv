:selected:","205-2 b) The Integrity Code describes the corporate and behavioural principles of the Mercedes-Benz Group. One of these principles is compliance with all applicable laws, e.g. for the prevention of corruption. The Integrity Code is binding for all employees of the Mercedes-Benz Group and the controlled Group companies and is made available via the internal Standardised Rules Database. It is therefore not necessary to differentiate the data or break it down by region and employee category. 205-2 c) The Mercedes-Benz Group also formulates clear compliance requirements for business partners via the Business Partner Standards (BPS). They specify these expecta- tions of its suppliers in the Responsible Sourcing Standards (RSS). The BPS and RSS also contain the principles of the anti-corruption policy. For strategic reasons, the Mercedes- Benz Group does not communicate any specific key figures of the business partners with regard to combating corruption. The BPS and RSS are published on the website and are therefore accessible to everyone. 205-2 e) We publish the absolute number of employees who were trained in corrup- tion-prevention methods during the reporting year. The defined cycles for these training courses are geared to the regularly assessed need for them. This is based on criteria such as the business model, belonging to defined high-risk countries, and functions. In view of this systematic training strategy, the Mercedes-Benz Group does not believe that publish- ing the percentage of participating employees compared to our total workforce, or break- ing them down by region, would be meaningful. Not all employees have the same need for these training courses, and therefore such figures should not be used as the basis for determining the rate of participation in anti-corruption training courses.",
