In conjunction with the intelligent range assistant, these services make suitable route suggestions, taking into account the charging stations available along the route. This enables the service to offer customers a charging and driving experience that matches their preferences. At the same time, the range assistant takes over energy manage- ment in the vehicle and suggests time-saving charging stops in order to reach the destination as quickly as possible.","electric vehicle - with the current EU electricity mix - is generated during the use phase, i.e. owing to CO2-emit- ting charging processes. However, whether a public charging point draws green power or power from non-renewable sources is often not known. The charg- ing point operator is responsible for providing the charging current. This is another reason why the Mercedes-Benz Group is expanding its activities in the area of charging networks, in order to ensure greater transparency with regard to the provision of green elec- tricity."

The ultimate goal is to offer customers the best charging experience in the industry in terms of reliability, convenience, sustainability and value retention.",,
Green charging with Mercedes me Charge,,
The Mercedes-Benz Group wants to specifically pro- mote the use of electricity from renewable energies. To,"Where electricity from renewable energy sources is not yet available, ""Green Charging"" uses green electricity certificates which ensure that an equivalent amount of electricity from renewable energy sources is fed into the power grid for charging processes via Mercedes me Charge. This green electricity is supplied from energy generation plants (exclusively wind and photovoltaic) that are certified by the green electricity label O EKOenergy. For every megawatt-hour of green elec- tricity, EKOenergy contributes a fixed amount to a cli- mate fund with projects to promote the expansion of new small-scale renewable energy plants in developing countries. This promotes additionality, i.e. additional benefits for the environment.",Green charging in the Mercedes-Benz Charging Network

For this reason, the Group has made ""green charging"" an integral part of its Mercedes me Charge charging solution in Europe, Canada and the USA.",,"Alongside the development and production of electric vehicles, the Mercedes-Benz Group also wants to improve the framework conditions for the use of elec- tric vehicles worldwide. To this end, the Group is plan- ning to set up a global Mercedes-Benz charging net- work in North America, Europe, China and other key markets. With its own global charging network, the Mercedes-Benz Group seeks to set new standards for fast, convenient and green charging of electric vehicles. In October 2023, the first Mercedes-Benz Charging Hub went into operation in Chengdu (China), followed by two further charging hubs in Atlanta (USA) and Mann- heim (Germany). By the end of the decade, more than 2000 charging hubs with over 10,000 charging points are to be created worldwide."
"With Mercedes me Charge, the Mercedes-Benz Group gives its customers access to one of the largest public charging networks in the world. The Group is continu- ously expanding this service, adding new charging sta- tions and extending the use of the service to other countries.
