Climate change adaptation With regard to economic activity 3.3, the EU Taxonomy requires a climate risk analysis to be carried out. In accordance with the DNSH requirements, this analysis was carried out for taxonomy-relevant production sites in connection with economic activity 3.3, in order to assess potential physical climate-related risk factors on the basis of material climate risks in line with Appendix A (Annex I) of the delegated act of the EU (Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139). The analysis took into account climate scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and different time hori- zons, including 2040. Adaptation measures were ana- lysed on the basis of the results.","Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources With regard to economic activity 3.3, fulfilment of the DNSH criteria according to the Taxonomy Regulation is intended to be ensured mainly on the basis of estab- lished environmental management systems and the internal environmental risk assessment (environmental due diligence process). The company has established environmental management systems at its own produc- tion sites around the world in accordance with ISO 14001. In addition, all German and the two European manufacturing locations in Kecskemet (Hungary) and Vitoria (Spain) have also been validated in accordance with EMAS. As part of the internal environmental risk assessment, consolidated production sites are evalu- ated according to a number of factors, including those relating to water quality, in a five-year cycle. Recom- mendations for minimizing risks are then drawn up, pri- oritized and tracked. The Group also uses external data"
