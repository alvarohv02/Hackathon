"supply. By 2030, the Mercedes-Benz Group plans to reduce CO2 emissions in the production plants (Scope 1 and Scope 2) by 80% compared to 2018. The target set and confirmed by the SBTi to reduce the CO2 emissions in Mercedes-Benz's own production plants (Scope 18","corresponding calculations for CO2 reduction. To evalu- ate sustainability-related investment decisions, the Group uses an internal carbon transfer price for its own production and logistics. An external auditing company audits a selection of tar- gets and their implementation on an annual basis. The Mercedes-Benz Group uses the results to adapt and further develop its climate protection measures. Responsibilities and organisation GRI 2-24 GRI 3-3 The Mercedes-Benz Group has more than 30 produc- tion locations worldwide, each of them subject to dif- ferent regional and national laws. Environmental and climate protection in production is managed and coor- dinated across the business units by three regional committees - Germany/Europe, North/South America and Africa/Asia. In the committees, the experts are able to network across the Group and plants and exchange information on legislation, processes and innovations. In addition, globally applicable internal standards and procedures are developed here.","European Union Emissions Trading System Industrial plants in which CO2 emissions are caused by the combustion of fossil fuels, and whose licensed :selected: O rated thermal input exceeds 20 MW, must by law"

All production plants operated by the Mercedes-Benz Group have been net carbon-neutral in terms of Scope 1 and Scope 2 since 20221. Since 2022, all CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) from these plants that have so far proved una- voidable have been compensated by carbon offsets from qualified climate protection projects.",,"participate in the O European Emissions Trading :selected: Scheme (EU ETS).

The Mercedes-Benz Group employs various measures in attempting to further reduce CO2 emissions - these include e.g. projects to increase energy efficiency or to expand capacities for regenerative power and heat gen- eration."
"The Group has been systematically recording its climate protection measures in an internal database for many years. It can use the data to efficiently manage the tar- gets it has set itself, as the respective measures can be stored and tracked in the database with the",,
