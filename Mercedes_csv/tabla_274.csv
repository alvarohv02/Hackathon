Modern safety and assistance systems ensure increased vehicle safety. A distinction is made between active and passive vehicle safety. Rated thermal input The rated thermal input stands for the thermal energy that can be fed to a furnace system in continuous oper- ation by burning fuel. After energy losses are sub- tracted, the result shows the thermal output of the respective heating system.","As an important raw material for effect pigments, mica is frequently used in the automotive industry. Due to social and economic factors, there is often a risk of poverty in the mining regions, with associated risks of human rights violations and poor working conditions."
"A company needs an emission allowance for every tonne of CO2. These can be freely traded on the market. However, the number of emission allowances is limited. This results in a price for CO2 emissions in order to give companies an incentive to reduce their emissions.",,Social commitment in these regions can strengthen local people economically.
