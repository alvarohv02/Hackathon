"The Mercedes-Benz Group is committed to improving children's safety in road traffic as part of its interna- tional initiative @ ""MobileKids"". The project is aimed at both schoolchildren and adults as well as educational institutions and provides them with extensive informa- tion and learning material on the subject of road safety.","With the foundations established by the Group, the Mercedes-Benz Group supports projects in the fields of science, research, technology and education all over the world. The @ ""Daimler and Benz Foundation"" promotes inter- disciplinary scientific dialogue and research projects.","Not only the Mercedes-Benz Group is showing social commitment, but also its employees: They volunteer for numerous social and ecological projects - for example as part of the ""beVisioneers"" support programme pre- sented above."

Replanting of mangroves - for the people and the environment,"reporting period, twelve new scholarships were awarded, and a total of 40 post-doctoral researchers and junior professors were supported. In various for- mats, the foundation examines research topics relevant to the future and contributes to strengthening the visi- bility and public acceptance of science through lecture series.","One additional example of employee commitment is the ""ProCent"" initiative: It allows employees to donate the cent amounts of their monthly salary. The Mercedes-Benz Group doubles these amounts and col- lects them in a fund. Employees propose projects that are to receive money from this fund. The donation vol- ume per individual project is between €250 and €60,000. Since the initiative was launched in December"
"Many mangrove forests have suffered from overuse or have been destroyed in recent years. In response, Mercedes-Benz AG supports the project ""Sustainable Aquaculture in Mangrove Ecosystems (SAIME)"" of the ""Global Nature Fund"" for the protection and restoration of mangrove forests in South Asia (India, Bangladesh,",,
Sri Lanka and the Maldives).,"It is also important to the Group to promote scientific research independently of economic interests. This is why there is the @ ""Mercedes-Benz Fund"", an unincor- porated foundation in the Stifterverband - a joint initia- tive of companies and foundations that advises, net- works and promotes holistically in the areas of education, science and innovation. The fund's support- ing activities were reorganised in the reporting year: They now contribute to securing Germany's future via- bility, innovative strength and competitiveness by train- ing and applying the necessary skills for a world in transformation. Since 1993, the ""Mercedes-Benz Fund"" has established 27 endowed professorships and junior professorships in Germany and abroad.","2011, ""ProCent"" has sponsored a total of around 1950 projects with more than €13,5 million. 80,000 employ- ees, around two thirds of the workforce in Germany, donated the cent amounts of their net salary."
"The aim of the project is to restore the forests, thereby contributing to climate protection and creating alterna- tive income opportunities for the local population. Sup- porters of ""SAIME"" have already grown more than 645,000 mangrove seedlings in 45 tree nurseries - over 300,000 of them at 70 project sites in Bangladesh,",,
"India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives. The remaining seed- lings were given to other regional reforestation projects. Measures to promote natural succession complement the planting and afforestation measures.",,
