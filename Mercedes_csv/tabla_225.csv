:selected: :selected: :selected:","205-3 a) The number of cases of corruption is reported in the ""Compliance Management"" chapter. Additional information about the type of corruption is not provided. We do not provide details about such cases, owing to the need to protect the privacy of affected individuals and of those providing the information. 205-3 b) and d) As a matter of principle, the Mercedes-Benz Group does not provide any information about human resources measures taken against employees. The Group is convinced that the personal rights of its employees in conjunction with the employer's duty of care preclude publication. Because of the small number of cases of corruption that are publicly reported, it would be possible to deduce the human resources measures taken against individuals affected. Irrespective of this policy, the Mercedes-Benz Group does not receive any information about the outcome of any criminal proceedings against employees. The Group is not a party to any criminal proceedings. As a result, we cannot make any statements as to whether or not an accusation of corruption has been con- firmed in criminal proceedings. 205-3 c) The Mercedes-Benz Group generally does not make statements about the total number of confirmed cases in which it terminated or refused to extend contracts with business partners, either extraordinarily for good cause or in connection with corruption. The underlying reason is that because of the small number of individual cases - in rela- tion to the entire sales network of the Group - it would be possible to identify the busi- ness partners in question in a certain region. This would not be compatible with the gen- eral obligations of secrecy between business partners.",no
