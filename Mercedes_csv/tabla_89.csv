"With its environmental and energy management sys- tems, the Mercedes-Benz Group ensures, among other things, clear responsibilities, transparent, standardised implementation of internal and external environmental protection and energy efficiency requirements, and comprehensive reporting at its production locations worldwide. As part of the local environmental manage- ment systems and the overarching Group-wide risk assessments, the Mercedes-Benz Group monitors the legal conformity of operations in the areas of waste management, airborne emissions, waste water dis- charge and soil/groundwater contamination in connec- tion with the handling of environmentally hazardous substances. If any relevant shortcomings are identified, the Mercedes-Benz Group records and rectifies them. To protect people and the environment, the safe and","include supply regulations. If products containing such substances are used, information is provided in the hazardous substance management system and appro- priate measures are taken. In addition, important key figures on hazardous substance management are pre- sented transparently at plant, department or cost cen- tre level. In this way, unit-specific targets can be sys- tematically defined and pursued. The Mercedes-Benz Group has also been working with the globally applica- ble ""Handling of Hazardous Substances"" standard since 2017, and has implemented this as an applicable stand- ard accompanying the ""Environmental and Energy Man- agement"" Group guideline. This includes specifications for the legally compliant use of hazardous substances, as well as corresponding specifications for substitution testing and therefore the use of less critical hazardous substances.","acquisition projects. Every five years, the Group assesses and evaluates its consolidated production locations according to a standardised process. The results are reported to the respective plant and busi- ness management so that necessary improvements can be made. In addition, the Group undertakes an annual review of the extent to which the recommendations for risk minimisation have been implemented at the loca- tions. The aim of the environmental risk assessment is to maintain a high environmental standard at all pro- duction sites worldwide. Measures and results Training courses on environmental protection"
"legally compliant use of hazardous substances must be ensured. To this end, the Mercedes-Benz Group has developed and implemented a comprehensive IT-sup- ported hazardous substance management system at its German locations and individual locations outside Ger- many.
