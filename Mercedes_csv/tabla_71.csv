"hydrogen-based direct reduction in 2022. Based on the use of 100% hydrogen, the Swedish partner company has reduced iron ore in its pilot plant, processed it into ultra high-strength martensitic steel and supplied it to the Mercedes-Benz plant in Sindelfingen. The first pro- totype parts were manufactured in the plant's technical centre and tested for series production. This ultra high- strength steel has the same properties as comparable steel from the classic blast furnace method. Specifi- cally, these body components are cross-members from the future Mercedes-Benz Modular Architecture (MMA) vehicle platform. The partners intend to use virtually CO2-free steel from industrial production from 2026.","Mercedes-Benz AG entered into a sustainability part- nership with the aluminium manufacturer Hydro in 2022. As part of this, the manufacturer has been sup- plying the foundry at the Mercedes-Benz Cars plant in Untert√ºrkheim (Germany) with CO2-reduced aluminium since June 2023. Compared to the average material used in Europe, almost 70% less CO2 is emitted during its production. This is made possible by the use of renewable energies in O electrolysis, energy efficiency :selected: measures and a minimum proportion of 25% :selected: post-consumer recyclate (PCR). After the successful test phase of the low-CO2 aluminium was completed, it was integrated into series production. Sophisticated cast structural components made from this material are used in Mercedes-Benz passenger car models such as the EQS and EQE. As part of its technology partnership with Hydro, Mercedes-Benz AG is aiming to use alumin- ium in its vehicles by 2030 with a carbon footprint that is up to 90% lower than the European average. In addition, by adjusting existing supply contracts, Mercedes-Benz AG has continued to work with its sup- pliers to decarbonise the aluminium supply chain for its production in Europe as a whole. At least a third of the primary aluminium used in Europe for future electric models is to be produced using renewable energies. This leads to a CO2 reduction of up to 50% in the mate- rial used compared to conventionally produced alumin- ium used in Europe. 7 More resource-efficient vehicles -
:selected:","In 2022, the Mercedes-Benz Group adopted the Responsible Sourcing Standards (RSS). They form the Group's central contractual document covering sustain- ability requirements for suppliers. The standards include its minimum requirements for a responsible supply chain - including environmental protection. They are aimed at conserving natural resources and prevent- ing environmental damage caused by economic activi- ties, as well as remedying such damage if it occurs. If the environmental damage is unavoidable or irrepara- ble, it must be compensated. The Mercedes-Benz Group is thus heightening its sustainability require- ments, particularly in the areas of environmental due diligence, climate protection and resource conserva- tion, as well as biodiversity, deforestation and water. In addition, the standards define minimum requirements with regard to human rights due diligence."

"Sindelfingen with high-quality steel from its location in Linz (Austria) using CO2-neutral rail transport. Since 2021, the same train has been transporting press shop scrap from the Sindelfingen plant to the steelworks in Linz on the return journey. This ensures that the scrap is recycled directly by the supplier. The future purchase of CO2-reduced steel from an EAF is part of a declara- tion of intent.",,"7 Social compliance - Requirements for suppliers
