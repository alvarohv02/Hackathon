Analytics for greater road safety and intact roads Since 2022, the Mercedes-Benz Group has been work- ing on behalf of the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management to analyse the condition of roads and other transport infrastructure on the basis of vehi- cle data. The @ Road Monitor project, which runs until autumn 2024, covers the areas of ""Winter manage- ment"", ""Road condition analysis"" and ""Road safety"". All provinces of the Netherlands, with a road network of more than 130,000 km, are included. UMS contributes high-quality and easy-to-use information to the project in order to make mobility in Dutch cities and municipal- ities safer, more efficient and more sustainable for all road users. In a collaboration with other project part- ners, state-of-the-art analysis software is used to eval-","dition of the road surface and traffic environment once a year. With the help of vehicles from the Mercedes- Benz customer fleet, which are networked via a cloud and equipped with sensors, the authority can now also record changes to the infrastructure, such as potholes, frost or winter damage, on a frequent basis and initiate the necessary repairs earlier than before. As part of the project, the continuous development of damage such as potholes, frost damage and other winter damage is being analysed. The data collected as part of the coop- eration with Mercedes-Benz is completely anonymised and only sent by vehicles whose owners have expressly authorised the transfer in the ""Mercedes me"" App. In North America, Mercedes-Benz took part in another pilot project from May to October 2023 with the aim of using anonymised vehicle data to improve the condition of the infrastructure and make it safer and more pleas- ant for all road users. This involved Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC providing the city of Boston with data from vehicles in the Mercedes-Benz customer fleet, which can be used to assess damage to the road surface across an urban road network that extends over more than 3,000 km. This data enables the city's transport authority to deepen its understanding of the infrastruc- ture and analyse how damage to the road surface changes over time.

"Pilot Project: Real-time urban traffic information Following the successful completion of various pilot projects in Amsterdam (Netherlands), Helsinki (Finland) and Stuttgart (Germany) the UMS unit kicked off the development of a series solution for receiving notifica- tions while on the move in 2022. The project was con- tinued in 2023. As part of this, UMS is planning to test the Mercedes-Benz Digital Co-Driver as an extended pilot project in Stuttgart at the beginning of 2024 and obtain customer feedback.
