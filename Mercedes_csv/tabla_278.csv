Pyrolysis,"A high-voltage disconnect device is a safety precaution in electric vehicles that deactivates high-voltage sys- tems. When this system is activated, the residual volt- age outside of the battery in a high-voltage system is automatically brought to a non-critical level within a few seconds.",
Pyrolysis is a thermochemical conversion process in which organic compounds are broken down at high temperatures. This enables converting biomass or plas- tic waste into high-order products such as fuels or,,
