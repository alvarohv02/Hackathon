All German and the two European pro- duction locations in Kecskemét (Hungary) and Vitoria (Spain) are also validated in accordance with EMAS. Since 2012, the German production locations have also had energy management systems in accordance with ISO 50001, which the Group has certified every three years. Outside Germany the Mercedes-Benz Group cur- rently operates ISO 50001 systems at individual loca- tions, for example in Kecskemét (Hungary), Jawor (Poland) and Vitoria (Spain). Internationally, the Mercedes-Benz Group continued to press ahead with the introduction of certified energy management sys- tems in accordance with ISO 50001 in the reporting year. New management systems were implemented at the locations in Pune (India) and Sebes (Romania). The individual divisions and production locations are simi- larly responsible for the conservative use of resources. They set overarching and location-specific targets and report on these topics to the respective management. This approach is derived from the target system adopted by the Board of Management as part of the sustainable business strategy."

GRI 3-3,The Mercedes-Benz Group systematically collects the most important environmental and energy data from its plants in order to monitor and report on its reduction targets. This data is entered into a central environmen- tal data information system by the worldwide produc- tion locations and subsequently evaluated.,

For the internal review, it has defined key figures which it monitors regularly. The Mercedes- Benz Group has entrusted an auditing firm with the external review. This reviews a selection of Group tar- gets and their implementation on an annual basis.

"By optimising energy efficiency, the Mercedes-Benz Group is reducing energy consumption, conserving resources and at the same time reducing CO2 emissions in production. The Mercedes-Benz Group also seeks to reduce its water consumption - for example by recy- cling water, i.e. treating and utilising it several times for production purposes. It is also important to reduce the quantities of waste. To achieve this, the Mercedes-Benz Group is stepping up its efforts to reduce the consump- tion of raw materials and materials at its locations. The",,
