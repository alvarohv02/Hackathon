Selection Rationale,"(1) Aligns with the TCFD recommendation to consider a 1.5℃ scenario for the '2℃ or lower' scenario, and (2) and recognized by investors as an external, reputable scenario.","(1) Possible decarbonization path for the steel sector considering forward looking technology, market and policy developments, and (2) meets the TCFD recommendations for considering '2°℃ or lower' scenario.","(1) Assesses performance in a context where decarbonization policies do not progress beyond current levels, and (2) incorporates other uncertainties such as energy security priorities.",(1) SSP5-8.5 is considered by the TCFD to be best- practice scenario to understand stressed exposure to plausible physical risks.
Description,"Holds warming to approximately 1.5°C, aligned with the Paris Agreement. Advanced economies reach net zero in advance of others and the scenario accounts for SDGs. Global steel emissions fall to around 0.22Gt by 2050.","Below 2℃ scenario, exploring regional variations in low-carbon policies. Europe, U.S. and Canada are ahead of the decarbonization trend; China achieves carbon neutrality by 2060; India by 2070, Russia follows limited climate targets.","Scenario aligned with current policies, assuming limited additional policy support for decarbonization of the steel sector.",A high reference scenario with no additional climate policy - current CO2 levels double by 2050.
