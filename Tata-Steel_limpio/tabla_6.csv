Preconditions,Making our production process more sustainable is an extensive and complex operation. The necessary speed at which we want to realise the switch to hydrogen makes it essential that a number of conditions are met. Conditions that enable our steel production and the wider industrial sector in the Netherlands to become more sustainable are:,"New infrastructure for sufficient green electricity, hydrogen and natural gas including the connection of the steel company to these networks.",Timely and prudent permit approvals: this is essential for the accelerated transition to green steel in a clean environment. The final permit is required by early 2026 at the latest to meet current time lines.,We expect we need 100 kilotonnes of :selected: hydrogen from 2030. This can be scaled up to a maximum of 220 kilotonnes of hydrogen during the first phase.,Financial support mechanisms and a level playing field (fair competition) at European level: all this is necessary to ensure the operational costs of green
,,,,Financial support to facilitate the necessary investments.,"steel production will be economically viable. To that end, the availability of affordable green hydrogen is critical."
