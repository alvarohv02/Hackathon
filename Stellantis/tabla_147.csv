Risk #8,Fair-Trade
Risk Description,"We are highly cognizant that our business model depends on operation within accepted norms of international trade. In the absence of our compliance with these norms, the management of our international supply chains would become more challenging and costly, increasing the costs of our products ultimately to the consumer."
Achievements/ Opportunities,"With operations spanning more than 130 countries, Stellantis supports the World Trade Organization (WTO) rules-based system and encourages international trade deals. Trade agreements foster innovation, growth and wider customer choices at lower prices. The Company favors the elimination of tariffs, as well as a greater convergence towards international standards and trade facilitation, to provide better market access by reducing technical barriers and customs procedures in both a proportional and coordinated manner. Where appropriate, our compliance processes are not limited to complying with the law. For example, in addition to compliance with regulations regarding integrity in business relationships, consumer protection and personal data protection rules (GDPR), we consider other types of guidance such as OECD Guidelines, ILO conventions, UN Global Compact, and the International Monetary Fund's initiatives for distribution of value, progressive taxation, investment in human capital and development of inclusive growth."
