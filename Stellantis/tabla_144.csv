Risk #1,Competition
Risk Description,"Competition in the marketplace is a subject of significant scrutiny by relevant authorities all over the world. Penalties for infractions to fair competition laws are serious, are often for significant monetary amounts and tend to generate private litigation."
Achievements/ Opportunities,"We believe in robust and fair competition in the marketplace, and strongly support the benefits it provides to our customers. Competition also promotes innovation. We work to strictly follow the competition laws that apply to our business all over the world to prevent anticompetitive and unfair trade practices such as market-sharing, price-fixing, information sharing and dumping. An antitrust policy has been released for all employees.
