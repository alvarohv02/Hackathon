Risk #4,Public Affairs Engagement
Risk Description,"Our interactions with governments allow legislative bodies to develop regulations and standards that are responsive to the needs of our customers, communities and other stakeholders.

Also, failure to engage with governments would risk the perspectives and expertise of Stellantis not being included in the creation and amendment of legislation, regulations and governmental policy."
Achievements/ Opportunities,"The Global Public Affairs Department is dedicated and trained to ensure an efficient and fair working relationship with governments, in full compliance with the law and corporate policies regarding anti-corruption. We impose controls to implement the Stellantis policy that no Company funds or assets may be used for contributions to any political party or candidate.
