RISK DESCRIPTION,MITIGATION STRATEGY,ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES
"The transition from ICE to electrified vehicles is modifying the need for raw materials. As Stellantis implements electrified powertrain applications throughout its portfolio, it depends on a significant supply of lithium, nickel and cobalt and on the supply of parts. POTENTIAL IMPACT Increased market power of raw materials and batteries suppliers may negatively impact Stellantis' ability to negotiate with its suppliers and may provoke raw material inflation. Price increases would increase Stellantis' operating costs and could reduce profitability. If the increased costs are passed through to customers via higher vehicles prices, the demand addressed to the products sold by Stellantis might decrease. Certain raw materials needed in lithium-ion batteries are sourced from a limited number of suppliers and countries. These may be susceptible to supply shortages or disruptions. Their sourcing may also cause negative environmental or social impacts. The global demand and supply of a single part could have huge impacts on our production. If Stellantis fails to optimize the raw materials and components used in its manufacturing processes, it may face increased production costs.",Implementing battery circular economy solutions to reduce automobile manufacturers' pressure on scarce raw materials < 6.1.7.7 >.,Planning dual chemistry battery strategy and solid-state batteries. From 2024 dual chemistry strategy with one cobalt-free battery to relieve EVs of raw materials concerns.
,"A vertical integration strategy for LEV production. Automotive Cells Company (ACC - European partnership with TotalEnergies and Mercedes-Benz) and two other JVs (one with Samsung SDI and one with LG Energy Solutions in North America) planned five gigafactories in Europe and North America by 2025. Those are meant to secure Stellantis' battery supply <2.5.3.2.2 >. Carbon-free European and North American lithium sourcing & supply contracts for critical raw materials. Stellantis signed direct off take contracts with two lithium geothermal partners in Europe and North America. Tier 1 battery suppliers also secured anode/cathode supply contracts in Europe. In addition, Stellantis has signed supply deals for critical raw materials (nickel, cobalt, manganese copper, rare earths) <2.5.3.2.2 >.",Joint development agreement signed with Factorial Energy to become a significant player in the solid-state batteries market in 2026 < 2.5.3.2.4 >. Relying on alternative sourcing. Stellantis promotes the materials coming from recycling supply chains. Engineering resources are dedicated to increasing their rate in the production of vehicles < 6.1.7.2 >. Reducing CO2 emissions in the supply chain. Resource efficiency is an opportunity to combine competitiveness and climate change mitigation. Reducing the consumption of raw materials is a win-win situation: it reduces the purchases expenditures as well as the carbon footprint < 2.7 >. The life cycle assessment will enhance the visibility on lower tier down to the raw material producer.
Risk #4: Changing mobility market due to shifts in customer preferences Type of risk: Transition Risk: Market Timeframe: Medium-term (2026-2035),,
Risk,Opportunities,
RISK DESCRIPTION,MITIGATION STRATEGY,ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES
"The automotive industry is facing disruptive trends that range from the emergence of the mobility services market to the acceleration of new technologies such as the autonomous vehicle. Automotive markets are shifting from vehicle ownership to shared mobility services that change the use of the vehicle fleet. More environmentally conscious consumers turn to product-service systems that encourage the collaborative consumption of goods and services. In some areas of the world, consumers are more reluctant to buy new vehicles and would rather look for shared mobility services. The risk for Stellantis is insufficient adaptation of its business model to new forms of mobility. POTENTIAL IMPACT","Developing a portfolio of mobility services to prevent any gap between the market and Stellantis' business strategy. Free2move and Leasys aim to compete with other actors, in and out of the automotive sector, on subscription economy trends. They represent opportunities for Stellantis to increase its revenue and gain market share outside of its traditional segments < 4.1.7 >.","Pursuing revolutionary autonomous driving projects as part of a multi-partner strategy. While tech players and start- ups should play an important role in the development of the autonomous vehicle market, it also represents a huge opportunity for traditional automakers who manage to launch innovative high technology projects < 4.1.7 >."
"As new forms of mobility gain consumer acceptance, vehicle sales may decrease in some markets. The loss of revenue could affect profitability, lead to asset impairment and a fall in their securities valuation. The mobility service market may negatively affect the strength of Stellantis' brands: new mobility services make it harder to differentiate a company's products from those of its competitors and therefore harder to encourage customer loyalty.",,
