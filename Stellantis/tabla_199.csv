Risk #1,Complexity of extended supply chains
Risk Description,"Stellantis seeks to produce vehicles that are attractive to our global customers based on their diverse values and preferences. Creating vehicles that delight the customer requires working with a complex and extended supply chain. We might face the risk of not being able to procure what we need because of concerns regarding human rights violations, market tensions, geopolitical disruptions, natural disasters and availability of natural resources, among others. The expectations for treatment of people needs to be clear for all levels of the extended supply network. For more information related to human rights in the supply chain <7.2 >. Some countries have requirements for local sourcing content and Stellantis must address this factor and the issues that may arise. Financial risk for each entity in the supply chain is important to consider. Complex supply chains often require a higher degree of coordination taking into account dependencies between supply chain entities and can be vulnerable to disruption due to the many inputs. One additional risk is the shortage of important raw materials due to geopolitical risks such as military or civilian conflicts and disorder or suddenly changing regulatory requirements becoming more inconsistent from one country or region to another. One other result of this can be local and global pandemic shutdowns that prevent actors at any level of the supply chain to produce goods and services as requested."
,"Negative impacts are caused by interruptions to the flow of material, whether raw material, parts or services. Failure to apply appropriate supply chain management can have long lasting effects. An approach based on continuous risk assessment with the objective of reducing exposure to risk and improving performance is an important strategy. Stellantis aims to secure its global supply and avoid costly downtime in global production plants. Potential Impact"
