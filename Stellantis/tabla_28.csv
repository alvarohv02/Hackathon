"The transition to low carbon technologies may lead to an increase in vehicle price and have a negative impact on the demand addressed by the company's products, especially if government subsidies for EV sales are not maintained. Manufacturers may not be able to generate profit from LEV sales as anticipated since competitive pricing might be used in order to win market share, while adversely affecting profits. Technological capabilities may prove short-lived if BEVs replace PHEVs sooner than expected. After-sales revenue may also be impacted as EVs require less maintenance than ICE vehicles. The transition to LEVs could create a loss of added value if carmakers fail to obtain expertise in electrified technologies. Since EV manufacturing reduces the number of workers needed per vehicle produced, increased LEV sales could impact workforce volume. However, eventual delays in the development of new technology for electrification may result in the loss of revenue and market shares. The inability to keep up with the market's electrification trends would prevent the Company from complying with CAFE regulations.","anticipating LEV pricing improvements due to a reduced Total
