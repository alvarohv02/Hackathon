Risk #1,"Human Rights violations in the extended supply network Due to the extended supply chain structure it can be difficult to ensure the avoidance of human rights violations. Supply chain management based on continuous risk assessment with the objective of reducing exposure to risk and improving performance is a critical element for Stellantis' supply chain management programs.
