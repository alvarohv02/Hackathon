IMPACT MEASUREMENT OF THE ELECTRIFICATION STRATEGY,
"EV adoption can be accelerated by Stellantis mobility services to facilitate the use of EVs and to foster customer acceptance. Stellantis automotive subscription programs such as Free2move Car on Demand, enable customers to experience an EV on a month-to-month basis. Stellantis car sharing programs such as Free2move Car sharing provide additional opportunities for consumers to experience an EV on a short-duration basis as we continue to increase the mix of EVs in these fleets. In addition, the launch in France of the innovative ""Electric As You Go"" pay-per-use offer introduces a new way to easily access BEVs, with a competitive pricing based on car usage. Free2move eSolutions and Leasys are also working to facilitate the charging experience. In 2023, the new eSolutions Charging App enables users to find a compatible and available charging station from a network in 29 European countries of approximately 600,000 charging stations (versus 450,000 in 2022). Sustainable mobility goes beyond simply the electrification of the fleet and seeks to align the diverse needs of a community with an inclusive, affordable approach which maximizes the utilization of existing assets. Leasys and Free2move have developed pay- per-use models where consumers and businesses pay for actual miles driven. Combined with asset sharing programs this has the double benefit of lowering mobility costs for our customers and maximizing vehicle utilization.",
"In 2023, these initiatives have met with favorable market response and the number of infleeted LEVs was 39,405 (versus 36,196 in 2022) representing 15,3% of total vehicles infleeted in the year (versus 14% in 2022). The development of LEVs through Stellantis' mobility brands enhances the ability to respond to evolving customer expectations and supports environmentally conscious consumers looking for alternatives to car ownership. Electrification also enables the emergence of new vehicles, such as the already available CitroÃ«n Ami, Opel Rocks-e and Fiat Topolino. These services are further reinforced through our Free2move eSolutions (F2MeS) joint venture between Stellantis and NHOA. This partnership is already supporting Atlante, a fast charging network in Southern Europe which will reinforce the synergy between electrification and mobility services < 2.5.3.2.4 >.",
