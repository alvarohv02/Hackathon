"Science shows that extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and intense, that incremental climatic changes are very likely to happen, and that their impacts are expected to grow more severe over the coming years and decades. The impacts of physical risks are uncertain, in probability, magnitude and timing. Water shortages represent a direct risk for Stellantis since its manufacturing sites use water for production processes . In 2023, 32 plants were located in a high water- stressed area (according to the World Resources Institute's Aqueduct ""baseline water stress"" indicator). These sites represent 33% of the Company's production volume. POTENTIAL IMPACT Stellantis' production facilities and supply chain are subject to risks related to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes and other climatic phenomena. Any catastrophic loss or significant damage to any of its facilities would likely disrupt Stellantis' operations, delay production and adversely affect its product development schedules and shipments and lead to a loss of revenue. Our suppliers and the entire extended supply network is also vulnerable to these same disruptive impacts, potentially leading to disruption in the supply of parts for Stellantis. The occurrence of a major incident at a single manufacturing site could compromise the production and sale of several hundred thousand vehicles. Any such loss or significant damage could result in expense to repair or replace the facility. Physical climate-related risks could also have an impact on the cost of insurance. Conflicts of use in water-stressed areas could have significant repercussions, notably economic and social impacts that would change the company's relations with some of its stakeholders. Inadequate water supply for the painting and refrigeration processes would increase Stellantis' operating costs.","Making and updating plans for business continuity and activity recovery at sites, according to their exposure to the risks and their criticality. Stellantis evaluates the probability of future impacts due to earthquakes and to extreme weather events on its sites and on its supply chain taking into account climate change impact on risk occurrence. Stellantis is thus able to identify the most resilient supply chain options and associated suppliers < 2.3.1.3 >. Relying on an effective risk-assessment method to evaluate the use of water in water-stressed facility locations and, as a result, to mitigate future climate change impacts in those areas < 6.6.4.2 >. Striving for responsible water stewardship. To anticipate conflicts of use in water-stressed areas and to comply with a developing regulatory framework, Stellantis set the objective to reach 1 m3 of water withdrawn per vehicle produced in industrial activities, an improvement of almost 80% compared to current performance < 6.6.2 >. Proactive environmental management of the supply chain. In order to minimize risks and avoid supply chain incidents, we monitor and require ISO 14001 certification from our supply base as well as carbon accounting activities covered by the Stellantis Supply Chain CDP Program. For strategic suppliers we additionally review environmental topics during top supplier meetings. Operationally, we work to optimize our supply chains by optimizing transport plans and routes < 7.1.3 >.",Reusing effluents for industrial use. Stellantis filters flushing water from the paint pre-treatment process and water from reverse osmosis to reuse them as industrial water < 6.6.4.2 >.
