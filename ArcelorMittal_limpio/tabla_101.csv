Hamilton (Canada),"In October 2022, ArcelorMittal, broke ground on its decarbonization project (the governments of Canada and Ontario having committed CAD$400 million and CAD$500 million, respectively, to the overall project cost) at the ArcelorMittal Dofasco plant in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, which is expected to contribute to a considerable reduction of CO2 emissions. The project includes the construction of a 2.5 million tonnes DRI facility and one EAF."
Gijón and Sestao (Spain),"ArcelorMittal is planning to invest €1 billion in the Company's plant in Gijón including the construction of a 2.3 million-tonne hydrogen DRI plant. This investment is expected to deliver a reduction in carbon emissions at the Spanish operations of up to 50%. At a later stage, around 1 million tonnes per year of DRI would be supplied to Sestao to be used as feedstock for the plant's two EAFs. On February 17, 2023, the European Commission approved, under EU state aid rules, a €450 million Spanish measure to support ArcelorMittal España in construction of the new DRI installation in Gijón. The Company is also planning to construct a new EAF for long products."
Hamburg (Germany),"ArcelorMittal already operates Europe's only DRI-EAF plant in Hamburg, where the switch to using hydrogen instead of natural gas in the iron ore reduction process is being prepared. The Company is planning to test the ability of hydrogen DRI on an industrial scale, as well as testing carbon-free DRI in the EAF steelmaking process. The European Commission approved €55 million of funding support from the German Federal Government towards the plant construction."
Dunkirk(France),"In Dunkirk, ArcelorMittal would build a 2.5 million tonnes per year DRI. This DRI will be coupled with an innovative technology electric furnace and complemented by an additional EAF. On July 20, 2023, the Company received the European Commission's approval of €850 million in state aid for the funding of this project."
Bremen and Eisenhüttenstadt (Germany),"ArcelorMittal is developing a project to build a large-scale industrial plant for the DRI based steelmaking at its site in Bremen, as well as EAFs in Bremen and Eisenhüttenstadt, following the announcement of the planned expansion of Germany's hydrogen infrastructure and alongside its existing H2 Hamburg project. In February 2024, the Company received the European Commission's approval of €1.3 billion in state aid."
Ghent (Belgium),"ArcelorMittal Belgium is planning to build a 2.5 million-tonnes per year DRI plant and two EAFs at its Ghent site. The DRI plant and EAF facility will operate alongside Ghent's state-of-the-art blast furnace that is ready to take waste wood and plastic as a substitute for fossil carbon. On June 22, 2023 the Company received the European Commission approval of €280 million in state aid for the funding of the project."
