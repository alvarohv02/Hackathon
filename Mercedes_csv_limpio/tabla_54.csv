The earlier the Mercedes-Benz Group takes environmental aspects into account, the more efficiently it can reduce the ecological impact of its vehicles. In order to utilise this reduction potential, the Mercedes-Benz Group therefore applies mar- ket-specific internal CO2 transfer prices in product development. Based on these CO2 transfer prices, prod- uct development monetises and evaluates measures to reduce CO2 emissions when driving, and to increase the energy efficiency of its vehicles in order to ensure that CO2 targets are achieved cost-effectively.","achieve the targets set by the Mercedes-Benz Group itself as part of its ""Ambition 2039""."

In all three core markets, far-reaching CO2 reduction targets for the road transport sector have already been adopted in legislation through the respec- tive CO2 and GHG new vehicle fleet regulations. These can be achieved by concerted electrification of the new vehicle fleet. Effective and ambitious fleet regulations must be complemented by coherent policy measures such as promoting the development of the charging infrastructure and the expansion of renewable energies.
