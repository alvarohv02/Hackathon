,,"The Mercedes-Benz Group is also using the heat gener- ated for its plants to reduce CO2 emissions from fossil sources: for example, surface geothermal energy is already being utilised at the Rastatt location (Germany). In future, heat pumps powered by green electricity will also be put into operation at locations such as Kecskemét (Hungary) and Tuscaloosa (USA). There are also plans to further reduce the use of fossil fuels such as natural gas by electrifying production processes. Interdisciplinary teams are also examining how renewa- ble heat generation can be further expanded across all locations. Several Mercedes-Benz production locations, such as Untertürkheim, Bremen and Ludwigsfelde (all in Ger- many), use district heating with varying proportions of renewable energy. In addition, some locations, such as Immendingen (Germany) and Jawor (Poland), receive heat from biomass heating plants."

In September 2022, the Mercedes-Benz Group began its planning for the installation of a wind farm on its test site in Papenburg, northern Germany. By the middle of the decade, around 20 wind turbines with a capacity of around 120 MW are to be built on the site as part of a PPA with the German energy park developer Umwelt- gerechte Kraftanlagen GmbH & Co. KG (UKA). This can cover up to 20% of Mercedes-Benz AG's annual elec- tricity requirements in Germany. An expansion with PV systems is also planned. The Mercedes-Benz Group liaises closely with the relevant local authorities and interest groups on site when planning the implementa- tion of the project and ecologically sustainable use of the area.",
