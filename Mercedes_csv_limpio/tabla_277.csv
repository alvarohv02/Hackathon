The first three mentioned are primarily used for the production of catalytic con- verters. The common naming of these elements is mainly based on similar chemical properties. For exam- ple, these metals prefer to form compounds with iron, nickel, copper and sulphur, as opposed to oxygen.","A power purchase agreement describes a special, most often long-term power supply contract concluded between a major buyer, for example a company - and an independent producer of electricity from renewable energies - the independent power producer (IPP).
