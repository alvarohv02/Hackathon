"In addition, both segments continue to negotiate with players along the entire supply chain, including elec- trode producers, refineries and mines. In addition to respecting human rights, a key requirement is to rely more heavily on renewable energy sources, particularly through the use of green electricity.","Mercedes-Benz AG has signed a contract with the Swedish start-up H2 Green Steel (H2GS) for the supply of around 50,000 tonnes of virtually CO2-free steel per year for the company's own European press plants. The new supply contract enables Mercedes-Benz AG to bring virtually CO2-free steel into series production. H2GS plans to start production in 2025.

"In this context, Mercedes-Benz AG is working with vari- ous steel suppliers and supporting them in their trans- formation in order to move closer to the climate protec- tion targets of ""Ambition 2039"". The increasing availability of CO2-reduced steel is an important lever for reducing the CO2 footprint of Mercedes-Benz vehi- cles. The establishment of industrial O direct reduction plants and smelting units is therefore an important pre- requisite for the gradual decarbonisation of the steel",,
