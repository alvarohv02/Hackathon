ANNUAL REPORT 2023,LIGHT WEIGHTING AND REDUCED EMISSIONS,
INDEX,Gestamp is continuously working to develop lighter vehicles. Weight reduction is one of the company's main areas of research. It is one of the most demanded requirements in the automotive sector due to the need to improve fuel efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions.,"of the extraction phase of the materials used, in addition to the use phase of the vehicles explained above.

1. Letter from the Chairman 2. Gestamp Group 3. ESG Perspective 4. Environmental Dimension,"Chassis and body components are essential for meeting emissions targets, as they make up around 70% of the vehicle's total weight. Also, as part of the electrification trend in the industry, the increase in vehicle mass due to batteries has reinforced the importance of lightweighting. Weight affects the range of the electric vehicle, and until the full decarbonisation of the electricity grid takes place, its consumption will continue to play an important role in the CO2 emissions of vehicles during the use phase. Therefore, Gestamp provides innovative solutions to offer the","Driving experience, comfort and dynamism are some of the key aspects that users take into account. Gestamp develops solutions that improve comfort and convenience when using the vehicle, such as components that reduce the noise and vibration of the vehicle, electrical systems that allow doors and trunks to be automatically raised and held or doors opened with the greatest safety thanks to a complete system of sensors that avoid impacts against obstacles. The main criteria for a user's vehicle purchase include driving experience, comfort and dynamics. This is leading to a rise in demand for components such as electric liftgate systems, noise and vibration reducing components, electric door systems, power assist steps and noise reducing tyres."
5. Social Dimension,best weight reduction results and meet the most stringent requirements of the sector. Extensive experience in hot stamping,
6. Governance 7. Annexes,technology and the development of multi-material solutions have led to various alternatives for lighter vehicles.,"At Gestamp we have been working on these components for many years and we are at the forefront within the sector. Originally and to date, they are components that are mounted on high-end vehicles and SUVs, but it is expected that in the coming years they will become a standard in all types of cars."
,"In order to take into account the environmental impact of, for example, weight reduction, life cycle analysis (LCA) of products is carried out as a strategic element in the design phase. As explained in the Circular Economy chapter, the carbon footprint of the different processes carried out at Gestamp and the materials used in the production phase are some of the main variables analysed in the study. For example, it has been found that the lightening of parts and the use of a smaller amount of raw materials are two of the factors that most influence the reduction of the carbon footprint. This is due to the high impact",
