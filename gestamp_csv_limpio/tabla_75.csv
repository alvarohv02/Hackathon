Activities studied and their adaptation to the technical selection criteria of the Taxonomy,Eligibility Analysis
3.3. Manufacturing of low-carbon technologies for transport:,It is interpreted as not eligible according to the selection criteria established in the regulations.
"According to the latest EU FAQ of December 2022, in a generic way. for the activities of 3.1-3.6, the components can be counted if they fit the selection criteria. Likewise, key components are not explicitly mentioned.",
3.6. Manufacturing of other low-carbon technologies:,"Not eligible due to complexity of data collection. Although Gestamp is carrying out life cycle analysis studies to prove the substantial reduction in emissions in the parts it manufactures, at the moment it is not feasible to obtain the figures associated with this activity."
"The description would include the manufacturing of other technologies not included in previous activities (3.1-3,5), which constitute a significant decrease in the GHG emissions of the product during its life cycle compared to the best performing alternative. available on the market. At Gestamp, life cycle analyzes are carried out to corroborate product emissions, and new materials are also tested that would imply a significant reduction in the footprint compared to the best solution on the market.",
