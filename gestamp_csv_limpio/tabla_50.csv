Compressed air,23,5.161,"1,155","Gestamp West Midlands (U.K.) has managed to conduct an aggressive compressed air leaks audit which helped to identify high number of severe air leaks. The identified leaks were listed, tagged, prioritized, and repaired periodically. This project has led to an annual saving of 357 MWh in the compressed air units."
Gas usage,4,"1,648",398,"Gestamp Polska (Poland) has implemented a project to reduce gas consumption by the installation of destratification fans which improved the circulation of heat in the facility.
This project allowed switching off the boilers during some periods leading to a reduction in gas consumption without undermining plant heating. After measure implementation 1,505 MWh of gas consumption were reduced annually."
New technologies,18,867,311,Gestamp Lapeer (U.S.A.) has managed to re- duce its electricity consumption by 259 MWh by replacing all inefficient lamps with efficient LEDs. New lighting points can be managed thanks to an intelligent management system which increases savings.
Non essential power consumption,32,"2,510",892,"Gestamp Vigo (Spain) has achieved an energy reduction in electricity through optimization in the extraction fan dedicated to a specific welding installation. After the implementa- tion of an efficient extractor fan, there is no need to switch on the general extractor fan since this installation counts on its own as more efficient extractor. Thanks to this optimi- zation the project has resulted to 27 MWh in energy savings."
